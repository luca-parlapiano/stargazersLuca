Create a simple mobile app, using the React Native framework, that, through the GitHub API, 

allows you to view the list of stargazers in a repository 
(the list of users who have added it to their favorites). 


The app must allow the user to type the 
owner and name of the repository and must therefore 


show the list (including avatar and username) of the users who have added it to their favorites.

DETAIL:

The details matter. 

Tests are expected, as is well written, simple idiomatic code. 

We will also evaluate both app architecture and API specs adherence, 

as well as proper UI/UX choices and documentation.
